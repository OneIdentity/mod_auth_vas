This is a simple tool to use SPNEGO to perform a GET request on 
an HTTP server. It was written to 
  * test mod_auth_vas
  * exercises VAS2.6/VAS3 vas_gss_spnego_initiate()
  * exercise VAS's GSSAPI without transition calls

When checking out from subversion, configure using:
    bootstrap.sh

Usage:
   get [options] -s URL                         - GET using no auth (simple)
   get [options] -n [-S spn] [-u user] [-g] URL - GET using "Negotiate" auth
   get [options] -b user:pass URL               - GET using "Basic" auth

Other options are:
    -e outfile               - Where to write the HTTP response code
    -d                       - Enable debugging

For -n (negotiate), the other options are
      -S spn                 - Kerberos service principal name to use
      -u user                - User service principal name to use
      -g                     - Use GSSAPI calls instead of VASAPI
