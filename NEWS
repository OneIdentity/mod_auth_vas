3.6.4	(2008-09-01)
	- Fix a crash on Apache 1.x when using Negotiate authentication.
	  Bug #563.

	- Avoid a possible crash after 10 hours (Kerberos credential expiry)
	  by renewing credentials every 5 hours. Bug #569.

	- Fix a memory leak due to incorrect reference counting on cached
	  user objects. Bug #575.

	- Fix `AuthVasRemoteUserMap ldap-attr userPrincipalName` returning
	  the wrong name for users whose sAMAccountName is different from
	  the first part of their userPrincipalName.

	- Fix auth_vas.conf.in being deleted during `make clean`.

	- Fix huge cache timeouts being clamped too small.

	- Refuse to build for Apache 1 without EAPI as mod_auth_vas has been
	  unable to run without EAPI (on Apache 1) since 3.6.0.

3.6.3   (2008-07-25)
	- Fixed a crash if the server could not establish Kerberos credentials
	  and then tried to handle a Basic authentication request. Bug #556.

	- Fixed platform detection for packaging. Bug #540.

3.6.2	(2008-07-11)
	- Fixed corruption of the internal auth cache that would result in
	  a double-free error, crash, or refcount assertion. This would affect
	  any server with "AuthVasUseBasic On". Bug #517.

	- Fixed setup-mod_auth_vas trying to use "-u service" when creating the
	  service account. Bug #525.

	- Fixed the error message when parsing an invalid IP subnet.

	- Removed failure-inducing "-z defs" linker option. Fixes undefined
	  symbol errors when building.

	- Detects the apache group in setup-mod_auth_vas when it is set by
	  environment variable, eg. in /etc/apache2/envvars on Debian &
	  similar. Bug #524.

	- Moved module compilation to libtool and automake instead of hacking
	  around apxs. GNU make is no longer required.

	- Added "make package" target to build a package for deb & RPM
	  systems.

	- Add ./configure option --with-32bit-on-64bit to build a 32-bit module
	  on 64-bit systems.

3.6.1	(2008-04-07)

	- Fixed "AuthVasRemoteUserMap ldap-attr" hanging the server when
	  using Negotiate authentication. Bug #510.

3.6.0	(2008-03-28)

	- New option: AuthVasAuthz for disabling mod_auth_vas authorization
	  checks altogether. Useful for accepting Negotiate authentication but
	  doing all authorization in other modules. Bug #482.

	- New option: AuthVasKeytabFile for explicitly specifying the location
	  of the keytab file to use for server credentials. Bug #369.

	- Support mod_auth_vas as an authorization provider for
	  mod_auth_basic by setting "AuthBasicProvider vas".
	  This is not appreciably different from using mod_auth_vas with
	  Negotiate disabled and Basic enabled. Bug #385.

	- AuthName is used for the realm in Basic auth as it ought to be.
	  Bug #495.

	- Fixed mod_auth_vas not working in proxy mode (sending wrong headers).
	  Bug #488.

	- Renamed AuthVasServicePrincipal to AuthVasServerPrincipal to better
	  reflect its purpose. The original name is still accepted. Bug #407.

	- Added caching of in-memory objects to speed up Basic authentication.
	  Can be tweaked using the AuthVasCacheSize and AuthVasCacheExpire
	  options.

	- Lower log levels for authorization-related messages, similar to those
	  used in Apache's authorization modules. Bug #247.

	- Check the user's primary gid in "Require unix-group". Bug #496.

	- Only try to add the +DAportable compile flag on HP-UX.
	  Thanks Scott Steverson. Bug #477.

	- Fixed problems compiling on HP-UX. Thanks Tom Hundt.

3.5.3   (2007-12-19)

	- Fixed "Require container" not allowing anyone access (bug #450).

	- Made the Basic auth failure log message easier to understand.

	- Removed -std=c89 build flag: it made the compiler too strict,
	  particularly on Solaris.

	- Removed -Wl,-z,defs link flag when building for APXS1 where we
	  expect undefined symbols (ap_*).

	- Fixed compiler warnings about unused variables when building for
	  APXS1.

3.5.2   (2007-12-17)

	- Fixed "Require unix-group" incorrectly allowing remote users if
	  there was a problem resolving the username (bug #445).

3.5.1   (2007-10-17)

	- Fixed "Require user" directives sometimes leading to
	  VAS_ERR_CRED_NEEDED authentication failures (bug #370).

	- Added an example CGI that shows the REMOTE_USER variable and
	  delegated credentials (if any).

	- Clearer logging of trace & diagnostic messages.

3.5.0   (2007-08-13)

	- New option: AuthVasSuexecAsRemoteUser (default off), fixes suEXEC
	  failures outside the DocumentRoot (bug #271).

	- New option: AuthVasRemoteUserMap to specify what to put in the
	  REMOTE_USER variable (mainly LDAP attributes).

	- New option: AuthVasNTLMErrorDocument to specify the error page to
	  serve when a client tries NTLM authentication (bug #210).
	  A built-in error page is served by default.

	- Extended the AuthVasUseNegotiate option to accept a list of subnets
	  to use Negotiate auth on (bug #337).

	- Test the keytab at startup where possible.

	- Improved setup script portability for Solaris.

	- Fixed case-sensitivity with Basic auth (bug #214).

	- Correctly set the intermediate module extension when
	  automatic detection fails.

	- New setup-mod_auth_vas option '-u' to specify the user account to
	  use.

	- Set REMOTE_USER to the userPrincipalName by default.
	  (This only changes the behavior of Basic auth - Negotiate already
	   set it to the userPrincipalName.)

	- AuthVasLocalizeRemoteUser now "localizes" non-Unix users (bug #319)
	  for consistency.

	- Fixed trace messages being printed as errors on Apache 1 (bug #317).

	- Fixed LocalizeRemoteUser and ExportDelegated not working on Apache 1
	  (bug #327).

	- Look for apxs in /usr/IBMIHS/bin for the IBM HTTP Server (bug #349).

	- Try linking to libgcc_s if vas-config's flags alone were insufficient
	  (bug #349).

	- Try to find APXS's compiler even when it is not in the PATH
	  (bug #349).

3.4.0
	- Log version number, libvas version during startup
	- Setup script changes:
