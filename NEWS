3.5.3   (UNRELEASED)

	- Fixed "Require container" not allowing anyone access (bug #450).

	- Made the Basic auth failure log message easier to understand.

	- Removed -std=c89 build flag: it made the compiler too strict,
	  particularly on Solaris.

	- Removed -Wl,-z-defs link flag when building for APXS1 where we
	  expect undefined symbols (ap_*).

	- Fixed compiler warnings about unused variables when building for
	  APXS1.

3.5.2   (2007-12-17)

	- Fixed "Require unix-group" incorrectly allowing remote users if
	  there was a problem resolving the username (bug #445).

3.5.1   (2007-10-17)

	- Fixed "Require user" directives sometimes leading to
	  VAS_ERR_CRED_NEEDED authentication failures (bug #370).

	- Added an example CGI that shows the REMOTE_USER variable and
	  delegated credentials (if any).

	- Clearer logging of trace & diagnostic messages.

3.5.0   (2007-08-13)

	- New option: AuthVasSuexecAsRemoteUser (default off), fixes suEXEC
	  failures outside the DocumentRoot (bug #271).

	- New option: AuthVasRemoteUserMap to specify what to put in the
	  REMOTE_USER variable (mainly LDAP attributes).

	- New option: AuthVasNTLMErrorDocument to specify the error page to
	  serve when a client tries NTLM authentication (bug #210).
	  A built-in error page is served by default.

	- Extended the AuthVasUseNegotiate option to accept a list of subnets
	  to use Negotiate auth on (bug #337).

	- Test the keytab at startup where possible.

	- Improved setup script portability for Solaris.

	- Fixed case-sensitivity with Basic auth (bug #214).

	- Correctly set the intermediate module extension when
	  automatic detection fails.

	- New setup-mod_auth_vas option '-u' to specify the user account to
	  use.

	- Set REMOTE_USER to the userPrincipalName by default.
	  (This only changes the behavior of Basic auth - Negotiate already
	   set it to the userPrincipalName.)

	- AuthVasLocalizeRemoteUser now "localizes" non-Unix users (bug #319)
	  for consistency.

	- Fixed trace messages being printed as errors on Apache 1 (bug #317).

	- Fixed LocalizeRemoteUser and ExportDelegated not working on Apache 1
	  (bug #327).

	- Look for apxs in /usr/IBMIHS/bin for the IBM HTTP Server (bug #349).

	- Try linking to libgcc_s if vas-config's flags alone were insufficient
	  (bug #349).

	- Try to find APXS's compiler even when it is not in the PATH
	  (bug #349).
